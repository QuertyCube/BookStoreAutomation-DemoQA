# Case Study 1: Payment Aggregator - Settlement Request Flow Testing

This case study covers the validation of the **Settlement Request Flow** feature on the Merchant Dashboard, which allows merchants to request settlements for their account balances.

All detailed test cases â€” including scenarios, steps, expected results, and mapping to user stories â€” have been compiled into an Excel document.

# Automation Scripts (DemoQA Bookstore)

This project contains automated test scripts for the DemoQA Bookstore application hosted at [https://demoqa.com/books](https://demoqa.com/books). The tests ensure that the application's features are visually correct, functional, and properly integrated.

## **Run a Specific Test Class**

To execute a specific test class, use the `-Dtest` option:

`mvn test -Dtest="ClassName"`

For example, to run each class on this project:

`mvn -Dtest=DeleteAccountTest test`

`mvn -Dtest=DeleteBookTest test`

`mvn -Dtest=LoginTest test`

`mvn -Dtest=LogoutTest test`

`mvn -Dtest=RegisterTest test`

`mvn -Dtest=SearchBookTest test`

## Run a Specific Test Method

To execute a specific test method within a class:

`mvn test -Dtest="ClassName#methodName"`

For example, to run the `userCanSearchBook` method in the `SearchBookTest` class:

`mvn test -Dtest="SearchBookTest#userCanSearchBook"`
